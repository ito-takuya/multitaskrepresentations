## Overview

This code repository provides demo code and derivative (processed) data to generate all main-text figures. It also provides some processed data for select Supplementary Figures (for smaller files). This repository includes all raw code that was used for analyses and modeling on the publicly available Multi-Domain Task Battery dataset. Some of the code is written for the Yale cluster, but in principle, the python and shell scripts can be adapted for servers/clusters.
